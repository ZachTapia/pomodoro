PomoDo-it is a productivity timer built using React.js (Hooks) and Next.js. PomoDo-it implements the [Pomodoro Technique](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730) to boost productivity and focus. When faced with any large task of series of tasks, break the work down into short focused sprints (called "pomodoros") that are spaced out with short breaks. This trains your brain to focus for short productive periods, helps you consistently achieve small goals, all while maintaining focus for longer.
